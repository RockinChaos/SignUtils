## SignUtils - Create custom utility signs.
-----

### Description
-----
```
SignUtils was built with the idea of being a multi-purpose plugin and the layout is designed to where a 
utility can be added to a sign as well as executed through a plugin command. A utility is to be defined 
as an action that can be bound to an in-game sign which allows SignUtils to perform that action upon 
interacting with the sign. The first example that this plugin was built around is determining the 
player's involved group(s) at the click of a sign. This also gives the option to see their own group(s) 
using a command or you can see another player group(s) by specifying their name.
```

### Installation
```
1) Once the SignUtils.jar is downloaded, the jar must be placed into your server's plugins folder.
2) Double-check the server's plugins folder for any duplicate SignUtils.jar files, such as SignUtils(1).jar.
3) Delete any found duplicate instances or there will be conflicting errors in the console window.
4) Once this is completed, the server must be restarted to register and enable the plugin. The plugin
   will then attempt to find your server version and generate a configuration based on the found version.
5) From this point, it is up to you to configure the plugin or join the discord for additional help.
